# Two-way communication

Transportation and MaaS providers are on the same team. As in any sport, communication is crucial for success. As such, it is important that we structure our businesses, technology, and other systems to allow for timely, two-way communication. This extends from the idea of data sharing, in that the data we share is useful for planning and informed decision making.

From a technology systems perspective, we should develop systems that provide two-way access to key functionality and business processes \(with corresponding authorization and security controls. Specific examples can include REST APIs with full CRUD endpoints, webhooks for pushing out information, and even pubsub channels for timely information.

From a business perspective, we should work to foster clear and personal communication between organizations. This can include sharing communications channels like chat, allowing outside participatio in some decisions, and even sharing office space for in-person collaboration and ideation.
