# Public benefit

We are all working to improve people's lives by offering accessible, high-quality, mobility services. It can sometimes be easy to lose sight of this goal, amidst our daily tasks and priorities. Thus, it is important to remind ourselves and colleagues that, like healthcare workers, we are working for public benefit.

Public benefit includes people around the world of the current and future generations, as well as the environment that sustains life on our planet.

## Cooperation

Working for the public benefit means we are all on the same team. We can safely cooperate between organizations, municipalities, and even countries. We are **not playing a zero-sum game**, because cooperation means we **strive for win-win** outcomes.
