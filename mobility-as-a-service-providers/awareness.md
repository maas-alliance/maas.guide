# Awareness

Change is constant. When it comes to journey planning, people need to be aware of changes as soon as possible.  This awareness helps us to **adapt** to the situation, **adjusting plans** where necessary.

A key aim of MaaS is to give people the right information at the right time, in the right amount. This is a delicate process, as timeliness and visibility of key information can be the difference between a successful or failed journey plan.
