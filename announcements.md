# Announcements

People and organizations relying on transportation services need relevant service updates. Some types of announcements include service outages, route or schedule changes, and new service offerings.

Service announcements should be provided in human and machine readable formats. Human readable formats can be discovered when people navigate to a service provider website or other information displays. The machine readable formats can be displayed to users via MaaS applications.

The general goal is to **provide people with timely and relevant information**.

## Announcements actions

When designing an **Announcements API**, some or all of the following may be relevant to end users and MaaS Providers:

* _get_ announcements
  * recent - a number of most recent announcements
  * within - announcements within a given time range
  * near - announcements near a given geographic coordinate \(when applicable\)
