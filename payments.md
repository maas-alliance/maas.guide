# Payments

Revenue is an essential ingredient to sustain the MaaS ecosystem. It is important that service providers can receive a fair compensation for their services, in as simple a manner as possible.

Increasingly, payments are made through electronic means. So, it is important that Transportation Service Providers \(TSPs\) accept electronic payment.

The method of electronic payment should also be relatively transparent to the end user. This means that, after a user has provided a  MaaS provider with a payment instrument, such as credit card details, the user should not be prompted  for further information or diverted from their journey planning when making bookings with one or more TSPs.
